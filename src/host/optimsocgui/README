OpTiMSoC GUI
============

Build Dependencies
------------------
- Qt 4.8
- libxslt
- libxml2
- libqwt
- liboptimsochost

Optional:
- doxygen (for API documentation)

On Debian/Ubuntu you can install all build dependencies with this command
(after you have built and installed liboptimsochost, as it's described in the
OpTiMSoC user guide):

$> sudo apt-get install libqt4-gui libqt4-webkit libqt4-xml libqt4-dev \
   libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev libqwt-dev

Building
--------

$> mkdir build
$> cd build
$> cmake ..
$> make

For a debug build, replace the cmake command above with
$> cmake -DDEFINE_DEBUG=true ..

For faster builds, you can also invoke make with the -jn argument,
replace "n" with the number of parallel build jobs (e.g. -j2 on a
dual-core machine).

Development
-----------

Main development is done using Qt Creator. Simply open the CMakeLists.txt
in this directory in Qt Creator and start coding.
