OpTiMSoC host library
=====================

liboptimsochost connects the PC host with an OpTiMSoC system using the USB
interface of the debug system.

An example command-line application is included to show some basic features
of the library and serve as basis for own applications.

Dependencies
------------
- libusb 1.0 (*not* libusb 0.1!)
- doxygen (optional, only for API documentation)

To install all dependencies onDebian/Ubuntu, run
$> apt-get install libusb-1.0.0-dev doxygen

Building
--------
$> ./autogen.sh
$> ./configure --enable-logging --enable-debug --enable-examples
$> make

You can now run the example in the examples directory or install
liboptimsochost with
$> make install

Documentation

To build the API documentation with Doxygen, simply run
$> cd doc && make apidoc

The output is available in HTML format in doc/html. Open the index.html file
with any browser to see the documentation.
